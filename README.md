# PageFund: Predictive Investment Simulator for Books

## Overview
**PageFund** is a fully-integrated Android application that simulates a dynamic, data-driven market where users invest virtual currency into books. Leveraging real-time metadata from the Google Books API and Firebase's serverless infrastructure, the platform transforms cultural prediction into an interactive financial model. It is designed to reward users for accurately forecasting future literary popularity using quantitative metrics such as average rating, rating count, and temporal sentiment proxies.

## System Architecture
### Frontend
- **Platform**: Android (Java, Android Studio)
- **UI Composition**: Modular design using Fragments, RecyclerViews, and ConstraintLayout
- **Data Handling**: Asynchronous data binding with Java callbacks and LiveData proxies
- **UI Responsiveness**: Dynamic rendering based on Firestore snapshot listeners, leveraging Observer patterns

### Backend
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (NoSQL, document-oriented)
- **Auth**: Firebase Authentication (JWT tokens, session management)
- **Security**: Firestore rule-based access control, context-aware reads/writes
- **Concurrency**: Firestore transaction blocks for ACID-compliant investment operations

### External APIs
- **Google Books API**: Provides book metadata, used to derive valuation factors
- **Network Layer**: HTTP requests via Java `AsyncTask` with JSON parsing through native `JSONObject` structures

---

## Data Model
- **Users Collection**
  - `uid`: string (auto-generated by Firebase Auth)
  - `balance`: double
  - `createdAt`: timestamp
- **Investments Subcollection** (`users/{uid}/investments/{bookId}`)
  - `bookId`: string
  - `title`: string
  - `author`: string
  - `avgRating`: double
  - `ratingCount`: int
  - `shares`: int
  - `purchasePrice`: double
  - `currentValuation`: double
  - `lastUpdated`: timestamp

---

## Feature Set
- 🔐 **Secure Auth Layer**: Enforced multi-step validation on email/password during signup; session token invalidation on logout or app close
- 📚 **Dynamic Book Marketplace**: Google Books API integration using real-time query responses mapped to Book objects via reflection-based deserialization
- 💸 **Investment Execution Engine**: Validates balance, updates Firestore atomically, and logs all transactions with timestamped metadata
- 🔄 **Valuation Engine**: Periodically polls for updated book metrics and recalculates market price using logarithmic weighting models
- 📊 **Portfolio Analytics Dashboard**: Fetches and aggregates investment performance in real-time with sell functionality and share-level tracking
- 🧠 **User Feedback Loop**: Contextual snackbars, toasts, and alert dialogs enhance transaction clarity and error recovery
- 🧾 **Persistent Session State**: Authentication context maintained via FirebaseAuth.getCurrentUser() and auto-cleared on session end

---

## Investment Valuation Methodology
PageFund introduces a hybrid valuation algorithm that reflects both mass interest and perceived quality:

- **Valuation Function:**
  $$
  V = \alpha \cdot \text{avgRating} + \beta \cdot \log_{10}(\text{ratingCount} + 1)
  $$
  Where:
  - \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are empirically chosen constants
  - Rating count is normalized to prevent outlier inflation
  - Values are rounded to 2 decimal places for display consistency

---

## Core Technical Strategies
- **Encapsulation**: Modular `Book` class with accessors/mutators to enforce encapsulation and facilitate polymorphic data handling
- **Error Management**: Centralized error catching with UI-level exception messaging and input rejection at both client and database level
- **Data Consistency**: Firestore transactions handle buy/sell atomicity and prevent dirty writes or lost updates under concurrent sessions
- **UI Scalability**: RecyclerView adapters auto-update based on snapshot deltas; supports future upgrades for pagination and lazy loading
- **Lifecycle Safety**: Background tasks are lifecycle-aware to prevent memory leaks and ensure main-thread safety post-view destruction

---

## Development Workflow Summary
- **Version Control**: Git-based iteration with frequent commits tied to individual features or bugfixes
- **Testing**:
  - Manual testing on Android Emulator
  - Test cases for every success criterion (registration, portfolio accuracy, balance integrity, valuation sync)
- **Task Management**: 50+ itemized actions tracked with estimates and timestamps (see full task breakdown)
